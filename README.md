# crawler
In this project we are using a downhill simplex method to find the best solution for crawling in different types of environments. The robot has to move its arms one at a time and find out how much it has moved forward. using a monte_carlo method, it uses the reward and it experience (past rewards and actions) to find out what is the best possible action afterwards.
